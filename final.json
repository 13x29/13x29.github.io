        "Government":"Almost in an orchestrated fashion, everybody in this tightly connected network decided to celebrate Teacher's day while being quiet about the historic verdict. It shouldn't come as a surprise considering the Government when asked for their stance on the verdict, had decided to pass on the onus to the 'wisdom' of the Supreme Court. Although outside of Twitter, the BJP Government has expressed mixed views on the issues before. While some like Rajnath Singh (Home Affairs) have held a conservative view, others like Arun Jaitley (Finance) have been more liberal.",
        "Opposition":"Prominent leaders from Congress were largely silent except for a cluster of closely connected group of leaders including Shashi Tharoor who has been advocating for decriminalizing homosexuality for a long time now. The overwhelmingly positive reactions from some seemed somewhat hypocritical considering the UPA government didn't do anything substantial, legislation wise, when in power. While CPI-M came out in support, other state parties remained quiet.",
        "States":"The chief ministers followed the Government in adding to the khamoshi. The network generally seemed to be talking about their local issues related to their state.",
        "Faith":"We see two distinct unconnected networks here - one by the Hindus and other by the Muslims. There was reaction from both networks - largely negative. While Subramanian Swamy and the Muslim leaders dismissed the verdict altogether, other influencers complained why Section 370 isn't being addressed. The Hindu figures who supported the verdict also didn't lose to take a dig on Muslims and Christians for not being progressive enough.",
        "Journalism":"The overwheming response from the journalists is not surprising. The responses were also very positive. Sudhir Chaudhary from Zee News who generally has a pro-government stance and the much admired journalists Ravish Kumar and Rahul Kanwar however chose to be silent. Interestingly, there were over 7 journalists who were talking about the issue before the verdict - indicating they were the most active of all groups on this issue.",
        "Law":"Judges and Lawyers were tweeting about the SC proceedings as they were happening, often quoting the positive statements made by the panel of five judges. Some were discussing the technicalities of the decision like if the law was scrapped or was it ammended. Menaka Guruswamy, one of the lawyers in the SC who was representing 20 petitioners from the IITs was being retweeted by most of the people in the network. Some in the network like ChandraShekhar Azad however weren't very excited about the verdict and took a jibe on the government for allowing this verdict.",
        "Sports":"The network of sports chose to be silent on the verdict with the exception of Yuvraj Singh and Anjum Chopra. However it should also be noted that sports people are the least active of all groups on Twitter - so we shouldn't be drawing strong inferences on their activity on Twitter. The ones who were active were mostly tweeting about the Asian Games.",
        "Bollywood":"The network of the stars with many one crore+ followers expressed their positive reactions to the verdict. The big stars - Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan and Amitabh Bachchan however decided to be silent. Kalki Koechlin has been a proponent of LGBTQ+ rights but she chose Instagram rather than Twitter to express her support - hence making strong inferences solely on this network might be misleading.",
        "Music":"The most active people of the Music network did comment on the verdict, but more than half of them chose not to talk. There isn't any distinct partition between the ones who reacted and those who didn't in the network as the two were uniformly distributed all over.",
        "Creativity":"This group comprises of people from different creative fields such as fashion, literature, culinary and dance. Hence it has low clustering of just 10%. Yet, we see a large number of the people react positively to the verdict.",
        "YouTube":"The YouTube network comprises of folks from the standup scene and brands like AIB and TVF. Decently connected together, the group has the most number of millenials, so one would expect a stronger reaction from them. The folks were talking mostly about their brands and upcoming programs. Many of those who did not react also weren't very active, so no harsh judgments.",
        "Entrepreneurship":"This network comprises of startup founders and VC leaders of the nation. While there was reaction from some of them, it wasn't the most talked about topic in the network. The folks were talking about upcoming tech summits and conferences.",
        "Forbes30Under30":"Every year, Forbes picks 30 groups/individuals under the age of 30 from different walks of life who have done something impactful in their fields. So it is no surprise that this group isn't really a close knitted network. Yet we see a close knitted network emerging here of which many did comment positively on the verdict. The rest weren't very active however on Twitter during the 3 days."
